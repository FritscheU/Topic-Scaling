# Topic-Scaling
Learning time-based topics using document scaling and supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation (sLDA).

We applied Wordfish to estimate document scores that later serve as dependent variable for sLDA.
The goal is to learn time-based topics without requiring a time frame to be set.

The number of topics could be increased to unfold potential hidden structures in the corpus.
